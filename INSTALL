redditWallpaper.php - 
sets all desktop screens to images it scrapes from reddit 

Just run it using php: eg: 

        php redditWallpaper.php

to put in cron eg for every 10 mins: 

        */10 * * * * env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/php /opt/redditwallpaper/redditWallpaper.php

to configure the subreddits: 
edit the file, you'll find an array with a list of subreddits at the top, change them. 
it scrapes the first page of a random subreddit in the list, and finds any imgur links, 
it then randomly selects one of those, and downloads it, saves it to ~/redditautowallpaper 
and then sets it as the wallpaper
