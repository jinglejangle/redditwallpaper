redditWallpaper.php - 
sets all desktop screens to images it scrapes from reddit 

Just run it using php: eg: 

        php redditWallpaper.php

to put in cron eg for every 10 mins: 

        */10 * * * * env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/php /opt/redditwallpaper/redditWallpaper.php

to configure the subreddits: 
edit the subreddits.txt file, 
you'll find list of subreddits, one per line. 
it loads the json from the reddit api for the first page of a random subreddit in the list, and randomly selects from 
/new /top  and default /, it then finds any imgur links, it then randomly selects one of those, and downloads it, saves 
it to ~/redditautowallpaper and then sets it as the wallpaper 

If you use Mavericks or linux with XFCE4 it will work out the box. 
If you use some other linux, if you install wmsetbg it will start working. 
Should be easy enough to add other wm set commands though.
